“DubEase” is an AI and Machine Learning-based video dubbing system that translates English audio in a 
video into Urdu language while maintaining maximum accuracy in synchronization of original voice and 
generating high-quality, natural-sounding Urdu audio with appropriate emotions. In the current modern era, it 
is a huge challenge for the production industry and content creators to provide content which will satisfy all the 
community. So there arises a need for automation in the dubbing process which will save time and cost unlike 
manual transcription and dubbing. Using advanced Machine Learning techniques, such as speech-to-text and 
text-to-speech translation, emotion recognition, and voice cloning, DubEase automates the entire video 
dubbing process, eliminating the need for manual transcription, translation, and dubbing which reduces the cost 
and time required for the process. DubEase provides high-quality output and provides replication of the voice 
in dubbed video. Its efficiency and features make it an ideal solution for movie production houses and online 
content creators, and it has the potential to revolutionize the video dubbing industry.
